1.  Include the gist css:
	<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://gist.github.com/stylesheets/gist/embed.css">
2.  Include jQuery:
	<script type="text/javascript" src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.7.1/jquery.min.js"></script>
3.  Include embed-gist (If your blog doesn't accept local file includes, then simply copy past contents into a script tag):
	<script type="text/javascript" src="gist-embed.js"></script>
4.  All you need to do to create an embed-gist is add a placeholder div.  The id of the div should be in the format:
	"gist-<gist-id>"
	e.g.:
	<div id="gist-1741" class="gistEmbed"></div>
